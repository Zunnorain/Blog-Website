<p class="wrapperforall">My name is Zunnorain Shah. Born in February the 21st in 1997, in Sargodha Pakistan. Since I was a young man, all I wanted was a gun man. Neverthless I am here coding away, working to build this website for my personal blog. I am currently a major in Software Engineer in my fourth semester. My dream is to build a website like Mark Zuckerberg and eventually turn it into a company as big as Facebook. I enjoy spending my free time mesmerized with textual scripts of my electronic device. LOL Other than that I enjoy reading a good book and dislike people who start reading 10 books at a time and then do not complete a single one. I would love to go back to Egypt with my family and live there far away from drama and trouble. Enough rambling! NOW GO READ MY BLOG POSTS!</p>
